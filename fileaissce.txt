In his first reaction to Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar’s switch to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Tuesday asserted that the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ has “taken the responsibility of delivering social justice” in Bihar, and that the grand alliance “does not need Nitish Kumar.”

The Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) consists of Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Left parties.

Addressing a rally in Bihar’s Purnea as part of his ongoing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, Rahul also mentioned the importance of a caste-census in the country. “The country needs a caste-based census to determine exact population of Dalits, OBCs, and others,” he said.
